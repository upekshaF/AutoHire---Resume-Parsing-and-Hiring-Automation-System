also known as a cv or vita, is a comprehensive statement of your   educational background, teaching, and research experience. it is the standard representation   of credentials within academia.    the full cv is only used when applying for academic positions in four-year institutions.   do not use a cv when applying to community colleges—use a teacher-focused  résumé instead.   tailor your cv to the specific positions to which you are applying and place more  relevant sections earlier in the document.  – for a position at a teaching-focused liberal arts college, the cv will strongly  emphasize teaching.  – for a position at a research-intensive university, the cv will accentuate  research.   format can vary by field, so also seek disciplinary-specific advice from advisers,  professors, and others within your field.   there are no length restrictions for cvs.  formatting    your cv must be well organized and easy to read.   choose an effective format and be consistent.   use bolds, italics, underlines, and capitalization to draw attention.   list all relevant items in reverse chronological order in each section.   strategically place the most important information near the top and/or left side of the  page.  – in general, place the name of the position, title, award, or institution on the left  side of the page and associated dates on the right.   use a footer with page numbers and your last name, in case pages get separated.  describe your experiences    articulate what you have done and take advantage of the opportunity to describe  your research and teaching experiences—do more than simply list them.   avoid the bland phrase “responsibilities included.” this can sound like a dull job  description. instead, use bullets to describe your activities, accomplishments, and  successes.  rev 06/2014     2 grad.illinois.edu/careerdevelopment   sections to include   the basic sections   heading: name, email address, mailing address (only one), and phone number   education: list academic degrees, with in progress or most recently earned first.    name of institution, city and state, degree type and major, month and year degree  was (will be) awarded   thesis title and advisor, if applicable  relevant experience: list positions that show off your skills and expertise. you can group   experiences into relevant categories to enhance your cv (e.g. research, teaching, and   administration). for each position, include:    title, organization name, city and state, dates position was held.   bullet points that summarize your activities/duties, accomplishments, and successes.  use action verbs.  publications: give bibliographic citations for articles, pamphlets, chapters in books, research   reports, or any other publications that you have authored or co-authored. use the format   appropriate to your particular academic discipline for a clean look.    presentations (oral and poster): give titles of professional presentations, name of conference or   event, dates and location, and, if appropriate in your discipline, also include a brief description.   use the format appropriate to your particular academic discipline for a consistent and clean   look.   honors and awards: receipt of competitive scholarships, fellowships, and assistantships; names   of scholastic honors; teaching or research awards.   references: three to five are appropriate. if you are responding to an advertisement that asks   for references, include those requested on a separate addendum sheet.   optional sections   qualifications or skills: a summary of particular or relevant strengths or skills which you want to   highlight. typically, this is not included as a separate section, but addressed in other sections.   occasionally, it may be appropriate to list special computing or language skills.   grants received: include name of grant, name of granting agency, date received, and title or   purpose of research project.   institutional service: list institutional committees you have served on, including offices held,   student groups you have supervised, or special academic projects you have assisted with.   certifications: list all relevant certifications and the year received.   professional associations: memberships in national, regional, state, and local professional   organizations. also, list significant appointments to positions or committees in these associations.   student memberships in professional associations are appropriate.   recent/current research: description of research projects recently conducted or in progress.   include the type of research and a brief description of the purpose.   community involvement: appropriate and relevant volunteer work, church work, community   service organizations, etc.   educational travel: names of countries, dates, purpose.     3 grad.illinois.edu/careerdevelopment   rachel green   2 1 0  w .  g r e e n  s t . ,  c h a m p a
